# Dark Matter Mapping from Weak Gravitational Lensing Data (KiDS)

## Overview  
This project reconstructs the **projected dark matter (convergence) field** from **weak gravitational lensing shear data** using observations from the **Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS)**. By statistically inverting distortions in galaxy shapes, we infer the underlying mass distribution using the **Kaiser–Squires method**.  

The analysis uses real survey data that includes shear measurements for over **200,000 galaxies**. This demonstrates a complete weak-lensing pipeline from raw catalogs to convergence maps.
